        <h1>Hi, I'm Kye.</h1>
        <p>I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying 
            cognitive science. I mostly use Python and 
            JavaScript. Currently, I am learning how to build a 
            website, a.k.a. the very one you are reading right now!
            This website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
